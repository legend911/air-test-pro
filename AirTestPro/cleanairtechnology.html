                    The amount of air purification technologies on the market today have 
                    risen dramatically. Each one suggests that it is the next greatest thing, 
                    but each technology is most likely only good at one function. The design 
                    of a product can lend itself to being an all-purpose product. The design 
                    of a products is truly what makes it unique to so many others. Fancy lights
                    and touchscreens are nice, but you want something that will actually work.
                    Many companies are just in the market to make a few extra bucks and truly
                    haven't done the research and development needed to make a revolutionary 
                    product. finding out if their products field results are true is hard to 
                    do. I will provide you with my own testing results that are independent of
                    any air purifier company on my testing webpage
                    <a href="indoorairqualitytest.html">Indoor Air Quality Test</a>.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
                <p>
                    Before you go any further, let me tell you that an air purification 
                    technology is only part of the equation. If it is used in the wrong
                    way or poorly it can be just as bad as anything else. For example,
                    if you put an air purifier in the corner of a room its performance and
                    results will decrease drastically. Most air purifiers are made to gather 
                    air from all four sides and sometimes below. If it doesn't have 360
                    degrees of space to inhale and exhaust air and particulates you will
                    have a marked decrease in performance. Also if the manufacturer decides
                    not to use the correct amount of filter media you will not see the
                    results that you expect. Many companies will just throw in a tiny 
                    amount of a technology just to say they have it. When you buy it and
                    expect it to last a certain time you are astonished when it is all 
                    used up in a matter of days or weeks. I have seen this all to often
                    with activated carbon filters.

                    In this loosely regulated marketplace it pays to have products that have
                    been thoroughly tested by independent parties. Many companies will do 
                    testing themselves or will even pay to have them done. In both situations
                    they have the opportunity to sway the results or the paid testers 
                    feel a sort of loyalty to their customer and will not tell the whole 
                    truth if it will not please them. Sometimes leaving certain tests out of 
                    the equation are enough to get by on results. Fortunately for you, I will
                    be your own personal tester. I will make sure that you are given the
                    information you need to make a great decision to improve your indoor air
                    quality.

                        Using a high quality air filter is your best option for capturing damaging
                        particulates like PM2.5 and PM10. It is also useful for capturing dust and
                        pollen, which plague just about everybody in the world. However many people
                        don't know how these filters work.

                        A filter within an air purification system is vital. You need something to not
                        only capture particles, but you need something that can hold a large amount of
                        them securely. In the beginning this air filter type was create to catch large
                        particles, but people didn't realize just how much the smaller particles detrimented
                        their health.

                        Most people who have noticed air purifiers on the market were pulled in by an 
                        add for ionic air purifiers that didn't have air filters and captures particulates
                        silently. This all sounded good until the government alerted everybody at how dangerous
                        using too much of this technology within a small space could be. Even today it is still 
                        used, but manufacturers have found ways to use it as a step in the process instead of 
                        the complete process.

                        Right after True HEPA air filters you will find activated carbon. Most people don't
                        know what this is until I tell them its the black rocks inside the water filter in a 
                        fish tank. It removes many things from the water to keep it clean. It can do just the 
                        same with the air when it comes to smells. Gas particles become trapped in its microscopic 
                        holes and stay their forever. It is truly a great product for a green home.

                        Electricity inside of an air filter seems like a recipe for disaster, but it is quite
                        an ingenious technology. Using static charge particles to attract particulates is great
                        for a combined air filter combo. It is not widely used, but I think it would be better
                        used in other applications.

                        actually comes into contact with it, but if other particles just end up trapping
                        it the bacteria won't be destroyed. With that knowledge it is best just to use a 
                        True HEPA air filter.

                        Using UV light is a great choice for destroying viruses and bacteria traveling 
                        through the air. Many hospitals use these technology in their HVAC systems and
                        it works well. You just have to remember that the viruses have to remain in the 
                        light for more than a second to actually be destroyed. The best application uses
                        several of these within the HVAC system and with a room air purifier it may take
                        several intakes for that to happen.

                        light is shined on titanium dioxide, which changes water in the air to a molecule
                        that breaks carbon type molecules (VOCs) into less harmful molecules. It is truly
                        a great way to destroy bacteria, viruses and VOCs.
