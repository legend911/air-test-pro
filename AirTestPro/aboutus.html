                    My name is Dwight Norris and I am the owner of Air Test
                    Pro. If you are not suffering from respiratory issues yourself,
                    you probably know somebody that does and would like to help them.
                    I have had issues most of my life. At birth I was regulated in a
                    bubble that covered my crib because I unable to breathe regular 
                    air for over 2 weeks. Now I am a year long allergy sufferer and 
                    I am determined to help you find a way to breathe easier.

                    Currently, I am working on becoming an Air Quality Specialist.
                    I have been working as a Quality Engineer for software and
                    hardware companies for over 8 years. I am the kind of person that 
                    must make sure the product is of the highest quality and 
                    workmanship. I have structured my testing to hit all the key
                    features of each product to see the performance visually through
                    graphical data.

                <p>
                    I have spent a large quantity of my career in the field of 
                    Quality Assurance. Many of these skills can be used to help me
                    research, test and display results for air quality. I am going 
                    to use my skills to do just that on this website. Quality asssurance
                    requires that you know the processes involved in a product whether
                    it be software or hardware. You also you have to be thorough at 
                    testing so that you may provide the customer with the best possible
                    product. I believe these things are important and they will help
                    me help you find exactly what you need.

                <p>
                    Within many of my webpages you will see pictures and videos of the 
                    actual technologies and products that I am talking about. I have
                    gone through this amount of work to actually show that I am actually
                    testing these products and you can watch me do it. When I describe 
                    a technology you will see it up front and center. You don't have to
                    rely on data on the side of a box or what some other website copied 
                    from the manufacturer. The data I am gathering is real and is not 
                    bias in any way. I do not take money from companies to do tests and
                    reviews. You can rest assured that the information you are seeing is
                    done by a real person in an environment where people actually live 
                    and breathe. 
                </p>

            <div class="col-md-4">
                <p>
                    You may also see that I have graphical data and a web application
                    within my webpages. The graphical data is there to help you understand
                    how all the variables that we test compare in different situations.
                    Everybody's issues are not always the same. One allergy sufferer is 
                    not the same as the next. One HEPA filter does not perform the same
                    as another. I intended to collect this data and display it in a fashion
                    that is usable for you to discover what works or why a product you have
                    is not performing how you would expect it. Many people have a certain
                    view of how bad their air quality is or how well an air purifier works
                    and it may just turn out not to be the case.
