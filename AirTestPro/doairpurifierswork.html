                    I must first acknowledge the fact that you have reached my webpage on this 
                    interesting topic. I am suspecting that you have an air quality issue big 
                    or small and you want to know if buying an air purifier will help or even 
                    cure the issue. I first want to say that before all else I want you to find
                    the root cause of the issue and solve that first. If this can't be done or
                    partially done then air purification may be a viable solution. Many people
                    are misinformed on what air purifiers are capable of doing and the vast 
                    range in quality of the materials, construction and design. I am going to 
                    demystify this information for you.

                    All air purifiers are capable of purifying the air, but what does that really
                    mean. It is just as vague as the small text in the bottom of a very long contract.
                    Each issue needs a certain type and amount of air purification to alleviate it.
                    Most of the questions like this spur from people buying systems from
                    retail stores and hoping that they will clean the air in their whole house. Air
                    purifiers can cover an area of a certain size with a certain fan speed and even 
                    then the filters may not be good enough or last long enough to work. Then you
                    have to think that a person with mild allergies won't feel much of a difference
                    while a somebody with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder (COPD) will feel 
                    the difference almost immediately with a decent system. I haven't even gotten
                    into the possibility of somebody trying to stop mold smell without cleaning up
                    the mold. I will go into more detail further into this article.

                    Before I talk about your questions on air purifiers, I believe it is more important
                    to think about your problems first. Air purifiers are machines that filter a variety
                    of things out of the air. Not too many people think about where these things in the 
                    air come from. Some things you can't stop like the fact that 80% of particles in the
                    air come from you, but others like water damage, which causes mold is something you
                    can find and fix before it becomes a major problem. I have heard of many people that 
                    want to stop a mold or smoke smell, but you should not ignore these issues by buying
                    an air purifier. Issues like these can usually be fixed by you. I want to let more 
                    people know that a lot of problems have real solutions instead of quick fixes.

                <p>
                    Most air purifiers consist of a fan that draws air through an air filter and
                    then expels the clean air out the other side. The air filter is made of different
                    materials to filter particular things such as dust and gases. You will find others that
                    use electrostatic, photocatalytic oxidation, ultraviolet light, anti-bacterial and
                    new technologies are being made at this very moment. As you can see each issue has a tool 
                    that will help reduce the problem, but you won't truly find one that fixes the
                    root cause.

                    Now that you know air purifiers are not a "cure", but more of a product that provides
                    relief we can talk about how they can help you. Many people have issues like COPD, lung
                    disease, mold, hazardous VOCs and dust. Not everything can be solved by one way, but
                    the best and safest way is by drawing in harmful particles into a filter that is capable
                    of capturing most things that could cause you harm. True HEPA filters captures most
                    airborne particles and activated carbon captures gas particles. This combination is a
                    well known standard, but most manufacturers simply don't provide enough of the material
                    in their products to last more than a month.

                    For more complex issues like mold, bacteria, viruses, hazardous VOCs different approaches
                    may have to be used. Several of the previous type have a decent way of removing hazardous
                    VOCs in low volumes, but not bigger issues. Ultraviolet light is well known to be an airborne
                    bacteria and virus killer. The issue nobody ever thinks about when they get an air purifier
                    with UV is the fact that it takes several seconds of exposure to destroy a bacteria or virus.
                    Most of these systems use strong fans that pull air to fast for the UV to be 100% effective. 
                    This is one of the few times where a strong fan doesn't help you that well. It is able to do
                    a full air exchange in a small amount of time, but it would take several passes for a decent 
                    amount of viruses and bacteria to be destroyed.
