                    One of my favorite topics is the air purification technology known as the True HEPA filter.
                    Now you may very well know what a HEPA filter is or that it filters air better than most filters.
                    However, you probably don't know the backstory about the "True" part of the air filters name. It
                    all has to do with the fact that too many companies like to cheat customers by cutting down on 
                    quality and amount of product. We can see this done on just about every product sold today. You
                    should probably look up the term <b>"Mandatory Obsolence"</b>. Basically, companies make their products
                    with a certain level of quality that will fail at a certain time period.

                <p>
                    Yes you heard me right, you are being cheated and their is almost nothing you can do about it!
                    <b>Things were "made to last" in the old days because.... they were made to last</b>. Now that is seen as
                    ruining profit margins if people don't have to come back and buy more after a certain time period.
                    This time period is guided by research on what people can "stand". This air filter is a product
                    of quality and government regulations while (HEPA-type or HEPA-like) air filters are a product of
                    mandatory absolence. Please look for the "True" statement and government standards that I will list
                    below in further detail.

                The air filters are generally made of fiberglass like most air filters, but one of the best decisions
                made to increase particulate capture was to make the <b>fibers randomly cross the pleated layers of 
                the air filter</b>. Unlike our clothing you will not see a repeated pattern of threads because this would 
                easily allow a particulate matter to go straight through the air filter without coming into contact with 
                anything and that is not efficient.

                Another great thing is the amount of ways that dust, pollen, pet dander, etc... will get stuck within these
                fibers. They could become stuck to it by just making contact, they could be blown right into a fiber directly
                or particles could just pile up like a traffic jam and just impede other things from penetrating it. This is
                a good thing at first because you can catch even small stuff like gas molecules, but if too much of the 
                air filter media ends up like this you will lose efficiency through airflow and you will need to replace it.

                    The Department of Energy (DOE) created U.S. government standard that HEPA will remove 99.97% of all 
                    particles down to 0.3 micrometers (microns). If you want to know how small this is you will need a 
                    microscope because it is virtually invisible. A human hair is on average 10 microns and a dust particles 
                    ranges from 1 - 5 microns. Pollen is one of the first things we know that can be visible or invisible to the
                    eye. However things like bacteria, paint fumes, coal smoke, smoke and carbon will not be seen by us, but it
                    can be measured in the air and it will hurt you if inhaled in mass quantities.

                My intention is never to scare anybody, but you should be well informed about what you are breathing in daily. Whether
                you be at home, walking down the street, in your car or at work. The air you breathe is not something that you can 
                ignore. People have done that with their water supply and have seen the devastation it causes. If we choose to ignore
                the air we breathe we will see a similar outcome. In fact several places around the world have experienced this or are
                currently experiencing it. In a lot of places it is getting worse because governments choose to ignore the issue until
                it is too late and their efforts have to be drastic to turn the issue around. If this article has done anything for you,
                I hope you are informed on what a truly great air filter can provide for you and your family.
